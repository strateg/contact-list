Task statement
Create a simple "contact list" application that allows:
- Listing people (name and photo)
- Searching by name
- Paging

Initial list should be one-time populated with people.csv attached. Contact addition/removal/edit is out of scope of this task.

Technical clarification
- Spring Boot
- Any build system
- Consider it as an enterprise-grade application (it will stay there for years, will be extended and maintained)
- As a consequence it should be DB-ready, meaning it should be little-to-zero effort to make this implementation use some enterprise DB (e.g. Oracle)

Expected outcome
A repository at your GitHub account from where you can clone the solution and run with little-to-zero efforts.
